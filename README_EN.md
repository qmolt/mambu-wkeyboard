# About

__Mambú wKeyboard__ is a keyboard that can play several tunings and divisions of an octave. The scales represented are _r_-cohemitonic scales made from totative intervals, with _'r'_ as a restriction of possible consecutive notes in the critical bandwidth from 1kHz. 
This app is written with Javascript, made with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).
The text font used is [Gest](https://github.com/laictype/Gest_Open)

# Notes

- All the tunings share one thing in common: the fifth octave's first note is tuned to 261,6255... Hz, this means every scale's first note of an octave has the same frequency. This also means that A = 440Hz for the '12 | 7' scale.
- Mambú was the name of a crazy dog with teddy-bear ears. This project is named after him as a tribute.
